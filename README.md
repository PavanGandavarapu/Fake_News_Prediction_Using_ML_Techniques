Machine_Learning_Personal_Project

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Pavan Gandavarapu. This is in short intro about my project Fake News Prediction.

Abstractâ€”Addressing the proliferation of fake news on social media and various digital platforms is crucial due to its potential negative impact on society. This personal project explores fake news detection by developing a supervised machine learning model capable of classifying English language news articles as true or false. Utilizing Python, Scikit-Learn, and NLP techniques, the project involves tokenizing text using the TFIDF vectorizer and extracting features to prepare the data for model training. I implemented two machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree and Multinomial Naive Bayes, to classify the articles. After conducting an experimental analysis with a publicly available news dataset from Kaggle, it was observed that the Naive Bayes classifier achieved a higher accuracy rate of 92%, compared to the Decision Tree model's 88% accuracy. The performance of the models was further validated using precision, recall, and F1 scores, which are documented in the classification report. This project not only assesses the efficacy of traditional machine learning models in detecting fake news but also highlights the superior performance of the Naive Bayes algorithm in this context.

Thank you.
